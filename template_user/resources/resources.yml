# 1. Change the entries in setup_settings according to your needs
# 2. Do NOT remove template_mn5_user_do_not_remove (it is used in utils.py)

# Developer notes:
# * we could technically make mn5_projects editable and therfore generalize to other systems...
# * if we add any foolproof utils to interface w/ resources.yml (ie, getting color schemes),
#   we could add them for real to this file
# * related to first pt, we could generalize more the # of systems we can allow for a user
#   to have

#         eye: red


# we could have here a list of settings to not touch?
