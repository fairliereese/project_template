## Analysis

In this folder you will find downstream tasks, usually related to data wrangling, plotting, and statistical testing.

<!-- Any notes you may want to add to the public audience about how analyses were done -->

## Organization

To help get started, we provide template R and Python files [template.r](template.r) and [template.py](template.py) with headers and example code that you can use to interface with the project environment. The headers must be copied to start your scripts, otherwise the framework won't work.

<!-- TODO add links / descriptions here
 -->

## Subfolder descriptions

<!-- leave the subfolder descriptions header here it makes the GitHub action work! -->

Details for each analysis task subfolder listed here.

<!-- * [dummy_analysis] -->

## Template resources

Included are a few files that demonstrate how to interact with the environment to make your files accessible without having to use long file paths.

* [template.R](template.R): Header and examples using R
* [template_python.ipynb](template_python.ipynb): Header and examples using Python iPython notebook
