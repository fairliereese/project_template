## Analysis

<!-- Any notes you may want to add to the public audience about how analyses were done -->
<!-- #### Notes:
* Most non-UpSet plot figures made by me were re-plotted in R for better aesthetics, and thus the visualizations in the following notebooks, though correct, look different. Similarly, sometimes the output is just a saved table used later to plot in R.
* Similarly, many statistical tests in these notebooks were re-run in R for compatibility with plotting.
* Any notebooks not explicitly described here do not contain work used to write the manuscript. -->
